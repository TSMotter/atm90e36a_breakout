Eagle project for a simples breakout board to test ATM90E36A IC.

### Notes:
- This circuit follows the schematic for the 3P4W circuit, present on application note *"Atmel-46104A-SE-M90E36A-ApplicationNote_043014"*.
- Components C22 through C29 are meant to be seen as a generic 0603. If you'll use the chip with Rogowsky coil, you should mount capacitors. If you'll use the chip with CT, you should mount resistors.
- This board served my needs but may need some modifications for your application. **Feel free to download and edit this as you wish.**
